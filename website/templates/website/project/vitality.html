    <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12">
        <p class="w-75">
            Vitality is a web application devoted to helping trainers and trainees search and connect with one another,
            while also providing the means to share schedules, dietary recommendations, and workout information in one
            centralized user interface. There is a diverse range of exercise applications that exist already but none
            bring together the ability to search for a trainer, schedule a workout, create a workout with a trainer, and
            share recommendations through the use of youtube videos within one easy to use interface, independent of
            what platform users decide to surf the web on.
        </p>
        <p class="w-75">
            Our focus on flexibility allows us to cover a higher demographic of devices than existing mobile
            applications or desktop applications. Vitality was developed with a responsive design which dynamically
            adjusts to all ranges of device resolutions and layouts. No matter how a user chooses
            to view our application, Vitality will automatically adjust and scale to a user’s needs.

        <h3>Deployment Architecture</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="pt-4 col-sm-12 text-center">
        <img class="w-50" src="{{ url_for('website.static', filename='images/vitality/DeploymentDiagram.png') }}"
            alt="Deployment Diagram">
    </div>
    <div class="pt-4 col-sm-12 col-md-12">
        <p class="w-75">As soon as the project started within sprint one, our scrum master wanted the
            deployment to be as automated as soon as possible. This includes unit testing, verification that a code
            review has been done on each pull request, and deploying the application to a virtual server in the cloud.
            Because of this, the team has demonstrated excellent use of continuous integration, a practice where all
            developers are working from one shared repository of changes, and the testing of applications is done before
            and after each merge to ensure each deployment is pushed with as little non-tested code as possible.</p>
        <p class="w-75">To make use of continuous integration practice, our project uses three main
            technologies, Git, Github, and Ansible. Git serves as our version control software which allows the team to
            create sub-branches of the mainline code being deployed, and tinker with the code before merging back into
            the master branch. Before each merge, a developer must create a pull request targeting the master branch on
            Github based on the sub-branch they created earlier. Github runs our unit tests on each pull request to
            check both the syntax and logic contained within the sub-branch. Once these checks have passed, a code
            review is then done by a reviewer, usually the scrum master. Once the review has been approved and no
            changes have been requested, the code changes are finally merged within the master branch, where the unit
            tests will run once more and any alerts will be presented to the team. The cycle continues for each Github
            Issue, a set of tasks created by the scrum master which must be completed to be closed, that has been
            assigned to that individual.</p>
        <p class="w-75">After a Github pull request has closed, Derek has set up a job within his
            homelab to run an Ansible script that would connect to a virtual machine in the cloud, update the vitality
            repository that was previously cloned, and trigger docker-compose to rebuild the repository’s docker
            container. Upon completion, the new instance of the flask application will be deployed alongside a second
            docker container hosting MongoDB. As clients interact with the website, the Flask application will connect
            to MongoDB where all the user and metadata are stored. These containers are also communicating with each
            other through a Linux bridge set up by Docker. As a result, no outside clients would be able to directly
            interact with either the Flask application or MongoDB. Because of this, an Nginx reverse proxy must be set
            up to route and manage all communications to the user.</p>
        <p class="w-75">Lastly, an Nginx reverse proxy is set up to enable support for HTTPS and
            redirect all unencrypted traffic to the encrypted channel. The Nginx proxy is independent of the application
            and is only a means to redirect and encrypt traffic. This means that while new deployments are being made,
            the Nginx server will be static and not need to be updated as a part of this process.</p>
